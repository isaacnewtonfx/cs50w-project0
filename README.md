Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Project Author: Isaac Newton Kissiedu

This project is a website that helps pet owners to publish their missing pet details and get informed via email when 
someone finds the pet.

The project relies on HTML, CSS,Bootstrap Framework, Nodejs and SASS which is a program for CSS pre-processing.
Nodejs was only used to install SASS using the command  `$npm install -g sass`
